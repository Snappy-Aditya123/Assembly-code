Random Number Generation AVR Assembly Code
This AVR assembly code is designed for an ATmega series microcontroller. It implements a simple random number generation algorithm using XOR and left shifting operations on a seed value. The generated random numbers are then used to control output on Ports A and B based on certain conditions.

Code Overview
Initialization:

loop1, seed, and a are defined as constants.
Registers r18, r16, r17, and r19 are initialized for loop control, seed value, constant 'a', and a counter.
Main Loop:

The main loop XORs the seed with constant 'a' and performs left shift operations.
It extracts the least and most significant digits and checks if the result is in the range [0x01, 0x3B].
Output values are sent to Ports A and B.
Port Initialization:

Port addresses are defined outside the loop.
Ports C (input), A, and B (output) are configured.
Conditional Skips:

Two conditional branches skip printing if the result is out of the specified range.
Subroutine:

The skip_print2 section adjusts the seed value based on a counter.
End of Program:

The program ends with an infinite loop (rjmp end).
Usage
To use this code:

Copy the code into an AVR assembly file (e.g., with a .asm extension).
Assemble and flash it onto your ATmega microcontroller.
Feel free to modify and adapt the code according to your requirements.
